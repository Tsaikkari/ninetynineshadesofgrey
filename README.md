This is my project through which I will learn several JavaScript ecosystem stuff like Node.js, Express, EJS, and React.

# Use the app:

### Install node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

###  Install node-modules locally: npm install

### Run the app by starting your server:

node index.js

### View it in your browser:

localhost:3000

### Install mongoDB from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ and start it.

### Add profiles:

localhost:3000/compose

### Save profiles into your mongoDB by clicking on the "Publish" button.

### Update the links on the buttons in the public/js/grey.js file.
