This is my project through which I will learn several JavaScript ecosystem stuff like Node.js, Express, EJS, and React.

To use the app:

Install node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install node-modules locally: npm install

To run the app start your server:

node index.js

To view it on your browser go to:

localhost:3000

To add profiles:

localhost:3000/compose

To go to a profile:

localhost:3000/posts/<profile-name>
