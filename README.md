This is my project through which I will learn several JavaScript ecosystem stuff like Node.js, Express, EJS, and React.

Use the app:

Install node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install node-modules locally: npm install

Run the app by starting your server:

node index.js

View it on your browser:

localhost:3000

Add profiles:

localhost:3000/compose

View a profile:

localhost:3000/posts/profilename

There is no database available yet.
